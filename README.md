## Projects
Here's my first machine learning project in my spare time
&nbsp;
### Predicting bank attrition
---------

Developed an attrition risk detection model tailored for the banking industry. Conducted an analysis and built the model within a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for detailed, step-by-step progress tracking. Following this, I created an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize client-specific results, enhancing the ability to monitor attrition risks effectively.

*Binary classification / Metric f1_score / Boosting / OOP*

You can find the dashboard [here](https://bankchurners-dashboard.streamlit.app).

**Data**

A dataset of over 10,000 bank customers, including their personal and behavioral characteristics, with the target variable being whether the customer remains loyal to the bank or moves to the competition.

**Approach**

- Perform exploratory analysis to discover how variables behave according to different criteria.
- Selection of relevant variables by combining important variables from several classification models.
- Development and optimisation of two boosting models: XGBoost and GradientBoosting.
- Analysis of mispredictions.

**Results**

- Selection of the XGBoost model for enhanced speed and robustness.
- Very balanced performance, with an F1-score of 91%.
